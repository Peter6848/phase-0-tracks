# JQUERY STUDY SHEET

## PLAN OF ACTION:

1. What the hell is jQuery?
  * Spend 30 minutes finding good websites on the basics of jQuery and how to implement it.  I want to make sure and spend the first 30 minutes keeping it as simple as possible.  

2. Spend time testing out jQuery.
  * Spend 30 minutes playing around with the info I find about jQuery from the web.
  * Take quick 10 minute break and think about what I should most likely learn next.

3. Dig deeper.
  * Spend another 30 minutes finding more in depth websites about jQuery.

4. Test deeper.
  * Spend another 30 minutes testing more in depth jQuery commands.

## STUDY RESULTS
  * I enjoyed studying jQuery.  I found it helpful to read and look at examples for approximately 30 minutes and then try and implement what I learned.
