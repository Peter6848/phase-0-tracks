# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to code/programs by allowing the user to re-wind and fast forward changes made.  It is useful in safeguarding your files by human error as well as keeps files in order to easily sort through.  
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a clone of the master file.  You can add/subtract to the branch without affecting the master file.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is pretty much a save point.  A good commit message describes what changes you made at the save point.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when the master file and any branch file are conflicting in commits.  The computer doesn't know which file to listen to.
YAAAHOOOOOO!!!
