#DRIVER CODE BELOW 

puts "Do you want to encrypt or decrypt a password?"
choice = gets.chomp
puts "What is the password?"
password = gets.chomp
if choice == "encrypt"
  p encrypt("#{password}")
elsif choice == "decrypt"
  p decrypt("#{password}")
else
  puts "invalid input"
end

#KNOWN LIMITATIONS: The code only works with letters, not numbers or symbols, since in this version, the reverse method uses only the alphabet as it's scope.
