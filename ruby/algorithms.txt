#PSUEDOCODE FOR ELEVATOR ALGORITHM:

- For each floor in an elevator 1-5:
  - Until desired floor is selected:
    - Stay at current floor.
  - If desired floor is selected:
    - Go to desired floor.

#ATTEMPT AT ELEVATOR ALGORITHM:

def elevator(floor)
  floor = rand(5)
  if
    floor == 0
    puts "1"
  elsif 
    floor == 1
    puts "2"
  elsif 
    floor == 2
    puts "3"
  elsif 
    floor == 3
    puts "4"
  else
    puts "5"
  end
end

elevator(0)
