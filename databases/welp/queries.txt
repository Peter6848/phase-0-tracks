1. In the welp directory, create a file called queries.txt. Once you've figured out the queries below, paste them into queries.txt, along with the output from your database.

2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

- SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

- SELECT users.firstname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

- SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id INNER JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id WHERE businesses.id = 2;
